## [AFRAME](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) 
Built ontop of Threejs it allows for quick and easy 3D creation using simple HTML

## [Supermedium - Aframe Addons](https://github.com/supermedium/superframe/tree/master)

## [Threejs](https://threejs.org/)
The most widely used 3D interaction javascript package, the pro of having it based on JS is that you can combine it with other JS packages to create even more immersive and creative outcomes with data visualisations, remote and MIDI controls, animation libraries and so much more.


## [Github To CDN Converter](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github)
I recommend creating a github to host your images, videos, models, etc and then using a CDN to post them to your web page. 
There are loads of CDNs but jsdelivr is a really good one for converting github links.
